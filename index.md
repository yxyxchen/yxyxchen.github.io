## About

My research lies at the nexus of Psychology, Computer Science, and Economics. I build reinforcement learning models that make human-like decisions, which aims to:
- uncover the cognitive processes behind everyday decision-making,
<br>
- and stimulate the invention of model-based diagnosis for mental diseases. 
<br>
<br>

I also develop automated tools for data analysis and online experimentation at scale, with the goal of increasing the accessibility of computational tools in the era of big data.

I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate with [Joseph T. McGuire](https://sites.bu.edu/cdlab/lab-director/).
