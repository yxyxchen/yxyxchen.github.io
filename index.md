## About
I build reinforcement learning models that make human-like decisions, which aim to:
<br>
<br>
(1) uncover the cognitive processes underlying human decision making,
<br>
(2) and stimulate the invention of new assessments of personality traits and mental diseases. 
<br>
<br>
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate with [Joseph McGuire](https://sites.bu.edu/cdlab/lab-director/).
