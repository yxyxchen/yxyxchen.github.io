## About

I am a Ph.D. researcher studying human behavior in an interdisciplinary field (a.k.a Neuroeconomics). Back in college, I majored in Psychology and Economics and serendipitously found my interest in Programming and Statistics. Now, I build human-like reinforcement learning models and develop automated tools for data analysis and online experimentation.
