## About

I study human decision-making at the nexus of Psychology, Computer Science, and Economics (a.k.a Neuroeconomics). During my Ph.D., I build reinforcement learning models that make human-like decisions, which aims to:
<br>
- uncover the cognitive processes behind everyday decision-making,
<br>
- and stimulate the invention of model-based diagnosis for mental diseases.
