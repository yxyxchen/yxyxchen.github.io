## About
I build reinforcement learning models that make human-like decisions, which aim to:
<br>
(1) uncover the cognitive processes that facilitate human decision making,
(2) and stimulate the invention of more objective assessments of personality traits and mental health conditions. 
<br>

I'm currently a PhD candidate with [Joseph McGuire](https://sites.bu.edu/cdlab/lab-director/).
